# International Team 9
Hello!  We are **International Team 9** comprised of exchange
students.  Our Team Members:
- Guy-Charbel Kairouz --- *President*
 - Benas Varanauskas --- *Vice-President*
 - Gustav Duer Wiese Pedersen --- QA
 - Marcel Boldt --- HR 
 - Leo Rey --- RnD
 - Arnond Suvannarat --- PR

Our area of development is Level Design. Our plan is to implement
procedural level generation that incorporates these features to
make the game immersive:

 - Adding random item spawns
 - Adding random obstacles
 - Adding a wider variety and increased spawnrate of enemy ships
 - Adding boss levels
 - Gradual level increase on enemy death
 - Adding different music to levels
 - Adding environment changes depending on level

To implement all of these features we also see that there will be
some dependencies on other aspects of the game for example:
Items, Player and Enemy ship variety, Sound Effects BGM, Two
Player mode.
